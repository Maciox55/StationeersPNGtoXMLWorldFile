# StationeersPNGtoXMLWorldFile
Tired of placing hundreds of iron frames and welding them to completion? Well, this simple tool lets you import an image file with the structure painted into your save file! This tool is perfect for those who are trying to setup a role playing server in Stationeers! Lets  you place hundreds of iron frames within seconds.

Check the project Wiki to learn how to use the program!

Feel free to contribute to this project, just clone, modify and pull request any new additions you might have worked on!
Let's make this project a community effort! The program is currently barebones and the original scope of the program is working...sorta...

I intend on working on this project in my spare time.

Things that I might work on next:
Layering, select many images and layer them to produce entire structures, this is currently partially supported with Z-Index, has to be manually set and new image selected every layer.
Custom Iron/Steel Frame Color.
