Feel free to contribute to this project, just clone, modify and pull request any new additions you might have worked on!
Let's make this project a community effort! The program is currently barebones and the original scope of the program is working...sorta...

I intend on working on this project in my spare time.

Update 1.01 on 01/02/2018:
- Added: Layering Support, upload many PNG files to create 3D structures, each file is considered a single layer, make sure you select the files in the actual order that they are supposed to be stacked.
- Added: Choose between Iron or Steel Structures!
- Removed: Z-Index offset, was causing problems so I got rid of it for now, all structures should appear starting at y=1

Upcoming:
- X, Y, Z Offset
- In-Program Layer Ordering

Down the road:
 - In-Program drawing and layering
 - More structure types
 - Custom Color Support
